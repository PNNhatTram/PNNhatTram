# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Nháº­t TrÃ¢m (PNNhatTram)!

### *InfoSec Student | Red Teamer by Passion | Risk Management Enthusiast*

---

Hello! I'm **Nháº­t TrÃ¢m**, a 3rd-year student majoring in **Infomation Security** with a strong focus and passion for the **Red Team** discipline. While my core drive is simulating advanced persistent threats to test and improve defenses, I also possess a keen interest in **Risk Management**. My dedication lies in understanding how vulnerabilities can be exploited and, equally important, how to effectively assess, prioritize, and mitigate the associated risks to an organization.

This GitHub repository serves as a dedicated space where I share my personal projects, experiments, course assignments, and study materials related to my cybersecurity journey.

### **My Core Areas of Interest:**

* **Red Teaming & Advanced Exploitation:** Simulating sophisticated attacks, bypassing security controls, and demonstrating real-world impact.
* **Vulnerability Analysis:** Discovering, understanding, and classifying weaknesses in software, systems, and networks.
* **Penetration Testing:** Performing ethical assessments to evaluate the security posture of systems.
* **Malware Analysis:** Dissecting malicious software to understand its functionality, origin, and potential impact.
* **Application Security:** Ensuring the security of software throughout the development lifecycle, from an attacker's perspective.
* **Risk Management:** Identifying, assessing, and strategically mitigating potential risks to information assets and business operations, bridging the gap between technical findings and business impact.
