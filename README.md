Hello! I'm **Nháº­t TrÃ¢m**, a 3rd-year student majoring in **Infomation Security** with a strong focus and passion for the **Red Team** discipline. While my core drive is simulating advanced persistent threats to test and improve defenses, I also possess a keen interest in **Risk Management**. My dedication lies in understanding how vulnerabilities can be exploited and, equally important, how to effectively assess, prioritize, and mitigate the associated risks to an organization.

This GitHub repository serves as a dedicated space where I share my personal projects, experiments, course assignments, and study materials related to my cybersecurity journey.

### **My Core Areas of Interest:**

* **Red Teaming & Exploitation**: Simulating advanced attacks to bypass defenses and demonstrate real-world impact.
* **Vulnerability & Penetration Testing**: Discovering and assessing weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications through ethical testing.
* **Malware & Application Security**: Analyzing malicious code and securing applications from an attacker's perspective.
* **Risk Management**: Bridging technical findings with business impact to assess and mitigate cybersecurity risks strategically.
